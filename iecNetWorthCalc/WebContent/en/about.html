            </ol>

            <h2>Assumptions on calculation</h2>
			<p>The Net Worth Calculator takes account of the following into calculation:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Net worth is the value of all your assets minus the total of all liabilities.</li>
            	<li>The asset value you provided should be based on the current market value.
</li>
            	<li>It is recommended to save an emergency fund of three to six months of living expenses to deal with any unexpected crisis. The “emergency fund” component of the chart will show 2 score or below for those whose liquidity ratio is not sufficient to cover three months’ living expenses.
</li>
            	<li>According to the <a href="https://www.thechinfamily.hk/web/iec/common/pdf/about_iec/IEC-research-knowledge-attitudes-and-behaviour-towards-money-management.pdf" target="_blank">IEC Research: Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour towards Money and Debt Management</a> published in April 2014, on average, Hong Kong people spent 60% of their monthly income on daily necessities. If your debt servicing ratio is equal to or higher than 40% (remainder of your monthly income after deducting daily necessities expenses), you should pay attention to managing your debt as you may find it difficult to make your ends meet. The “debt management” component of the chart will show 0 score.</li>
