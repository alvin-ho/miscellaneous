                <p>The liquidity ratio this calculator uses  is calculated by dividing your liquid assets by monthly expense. The ratio can be interpreted as the sufficiency of your funds reserved for emergency uses such as unexpected crisis or risk in life.

            <h4>Debt management</h4>
            <h5>Your debt servicing ratio <strong><span>40</span>%</strong></h5>
            <p class="error">Please provide the figures of your income and expenses</p>
            <div class="contentBox">
                <p>Debt servicing ratio is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward paying debts and is calculated by dividing your monthly liabilities by your gross monthly income. The lower the debt-to-income ratio you have , the better your debt management status is.</p>
                <p>Debt can be a growing problem if not managed properly. Even if you just owe a little, always make payment on time to keep your debt under control. Additional interest and /or penalty charges can add up quickly if you get behind on repayments.</p>
                <p>You can consider managing your debts with the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay off your debt as much as you can each month, at least pay the minimum you owe on each loan as this will protect your credit score. If you can afford to pay more, pay the loan with the highest interest rate first.</li>
                    <li>Consider consolidating your loans, lines of credit and credit card balances into a single loan with a set repayment schedule.</li>
                    <li>Tell your lender that youâ€™re experiencing financial difficulty. Sometimes, you may be able to extend the term of a loan or arrange to postpone repayments for a temporary period.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="contentBox">
                <p>Savings ratio is the proportion of income which has been saved and is calculated by dividing your monthly surplus by your monthly income. The higher the saving ratio you have, the better money management status and the quicker to achieve financial goals you are.</p>
                <p>Whatever your age or circumstances, it is good practice to work out your goals and start saving as early as you can.</p>
                <p>Here are some tips helping you to save money and budget better:</p>
                <ul>
