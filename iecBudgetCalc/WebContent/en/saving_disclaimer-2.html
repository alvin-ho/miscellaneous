			<h1>About savings goal calculator</h1>
			<p>Setting financial goals, whether large or small, short- or long-term, can be motivating and give you something to aim for. Our savings goal calculator enables you to work out your goals with three scenarios:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How much you will need to save regularly to reach your goal in time;</li>
				<li>How much you will have if you put aside a fixed amount of money regularly; or</li>
				<li>How long it will take to reach your savings goal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It offers the following features which allow you to:</p>
			<ol>

			<p>The calculator illustrates how your savings or investment grows with the compounding effect. The results, calculations and graphical presentation are for information and illustration only and provided as best approximate. Such information and illustrations should not be treated as the sole source of information when making a financial decision. Please speak to your financial adviser or planner for professional guidance.</p>
			<h1>Assumptions on calculation</h1>
			<p>The savings goal calculator takes account of the following into calculation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Regular savings amount" you specified is made at the end of the period you selected.</li>

				<li>It does not include some factors such as inflation and changes in the rate of return. When setting your savings goal value, you are advised to consider future price increases.</li>
				<li>1 year = 12 months = 52 weeks; 1 month = 52 weeks / 12 = 4.33 weeks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Scenario 1: How much you need to save</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The expected rate of return you entered is a constant annual rate for the full savings period and compounds on weekly, monthly or yearly basis subject to the compounding frequency you select.</li>

				<li>Yearly compounding only applies to saving period with complete year(s). The calculator will prompt you to choose either monthly or weekly compounding when the saving period is not in complete year(s).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Example: If you enter “1 year and 8 months” as the saving period and select “Yearly” as the compounding frequency, the calculator will prompt you to select either “Monthly” or “Weekly” instead since no return can be generated in the remaining 8 months with yearly compounding.</p>


			<p>Scenario 2: How much you will have</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The calculations will be compounded according to the regular savings period you select in the field “Regular savings amount”. For example, when you plan to save a particular amount every month, you will have to select “Monthly” in the pull-down menu where monthly compounding will be adopted.</li>
				<li>If your regular saving is on a weekly basis and the number you entered in the box of “month(s)” in the field “Saving period” is not a multiple of 12, the calculator will assume one month equals to 4.33 weeks.</li>
				<li>If your regular saving is on a yearly basis and the saving period is not in complete year(s), the calculator will prompt you to modify the saving period to be in complete year(s).</li>
			</ul>


			<p>Scenario 3: How long it will take</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Similar to Scenario 2, the calculations will be compounded according to the regular savings period you select in the field “Regular savings amount”. For example, when you plan to save a particular amount every month, you will have to select “Monthly” in the pull-down menu where monthly compounding will be adopted.</li>
			</ul>
