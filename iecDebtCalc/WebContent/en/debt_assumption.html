			<h1>About debt calculator</h1>
			<p>Our calculator provides you with an overview of all your personal debts, including credit cards, personal loans and other loans (eg relatives and friends); as well as options and tips to help you manage your debts effectively.</p>

			<p>It shows repayment scenarios with different repayment amount, repayment period and annualised percentage rate (APR) to facilitate review and comparison; and works out the debt-to-income ratio to measure the burden of debt over the borrower’s income.</p>
			<p>Please note that this calculator may not be suitable for calculating mortgage and student loans which have specific calculation assumptions.</p>


			<ol type="1">
				<li>Credit card
					<br/>
					<br/>The credit card debt calculator works out the repayment of credit card debt. The repayment period and cost of borrowing will be calculated based on user’s input on the debt amount, APR and average monthly repayment amount. The APR is specified in the credit card statement. Assuming no other fees and charges, the calculation converts the APR specified by the user to estimate the effective monthly interest and then works out the cost of borrowing and repayment period required to settle the credit card debt.</li>
				<li>Personal loan
					<br/>
					<br/>The personal loan calculator works out the repayment of personal loan. The average monthly repayment amount will be calculated based on user’s input on the loan amount, loan period and APR. The APR is specified in the loan terms and conditions or other relevant documentation. Assuming no other fees and charges, the calculation converts the APR specified by the user to estimate the effective monthly interest and then works out the average monthly repayment amount required to settle the debt.</li>
				<li>Other loan
					<br/>
					<br/>This calculator works out the repayment of other loan(s) using the flat rate. The flat rate refers to a fixed interest rate of the original loan amount regardless of the fact that the loan capital is declining each month. The average monthly repayment amount will be calculated based on user’s input on the loan amount, loan period and annualised flat rate. Assuming no other fees and charges, the calculation estimates the average monthly repayment amount required to settle the debt.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The calculator offers the following features which allow you to:</p>

			</ol>

			<h1>Assumptions on calculation</h1>
			<p>The IEC Debt Calculator takes account of the following into calculation:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The cost of borrowing is calculated by means of an APR. The APR takes into account the interest rate plus any extra fees or charges to be paid eg administration fee and application fees, but with the exception of the annual card fee, or fees and charges which are payable as a result of the failure of the cardholder to carry out his obligations under the agreement (eg default charges) or which are payable upon the provision of additional services by the card issuer (eg charges for temporary over limit)</li>
				<li>It assumes no annual fees on the credit card(s) and personal loan(s).</li>
				<li>Repayment(s) is(are) made on or before the payment due date of each statement.</li>
				<li>It assumes that repayment(s) is(are) made at the end of the month.</li>
				<li>It assumes no additional spending, unbilled installment or cash advance added to the credit card(s) over the repayment period.</li>
				<li>The minimum payment amount is based on the greater of 2% of outstanding balance, monthly interest plus 1% of outstanding balance or fixed amount of HKD 50.</li>
				<li>If the difference between the values presented by the chart is too large, the result might not be shown properly.</li>
